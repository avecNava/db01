                <h4>Get Ready- When should you start toilet training?</h4>
                </a>
                <p class="front-cnt"> How do you know if your child is ready to start, or the best age to begin? Learn about the signs should you look out for.</p>
                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <p>As your baby grows into an active toddler on their way to becoming a “Big Kid”, you’ll most likely start wondering when you can finally ditch the nappies for undies. Toilet training is an exciting and rewarding time, and one that will be different for every child. While some kids will  master the potty in no time, others can take a little longer.</p>
                  <p>One of the keys to successful toilet training is timing – the more ready your child is the smoother the process will be.</p>
                  <h5>The best age to start toilet training</h5>
                  <p>There is no magic or “correct” age to kick off toilet training. The truth is that no two children train alike, so the secret to success in toilet training is to tune into your child’s unique learning style and waiting for them to display the signs of being ready. </p>
                  <p>The majority of  children will be physically, mentally and emotionally ready to start between the ages of 18 months and three years (though most haven’t mastered the readiness skills until after their 2nd birthday). So rather than simply working on the assumption that there is a certain ‘right age’ to start toilet training, ensuring that your toddler recognises the urge to wee or poo and acts on the impulse is an important sign that they’re ready to start training.</p>
                  <p>Understandably, you’ll be looking forward to being done with nappies, but pressuring them to start before this point will not be productive and will only drag out the process. <a href="#girls-block" class="girls-btn">Girls</a> tend to be ‘ready’ a little earlier than <a href="#boys-block" class="boys-btn">boys</a>, so don’t fret if your little man is taking a bit longer to get started than his female peers – every child is unique and no two children train alike.</p>
                  <h5>Signs of readiness for toilet training</h5>
                  <p>Feel free to start <a class="sample-btn de-btn" href="#r-quiz">preparing for toilet training</a><a class="sample-btn mo-btn" href="#r-quiz-mb">preparing for toilet training</a> once you notice a few physical, mental, and social signs. It’s up to you to help your toddler understand the connection between their wiggling, leg crossing or crotch grabbing, and their need to go to the toilet or potty!</p>
                  <h5>Physical signs of readiness</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>They stay dry for up to two hours and/or stay dry through naps – this shows that their bladder capacity and control are improving</li>
                    <li>They have fairly predictable bowel movements and regular, formed poos</li>
                    <li>They have the dexterity to pull their pants up and down</li>
                    <li>They can walk steadily and without assistance – so they can get to the toilet by themselves!</li>
                    <li>They recognise the urge to go – you might notice some common signals like they now go off to a secret corner to poo or dance or wiggle around on the spot, grasp at their crotch or show funny facial expressions when they need to wee</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Mental signs of readiness</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>They know what wee and poo are and may talk about them when you change their nappy</li>
                    <li>They ask to be changed or complain about a dirty nappy – they may even start to remove it themselves after a wee!</li>
                    <li>They can sit still without being distracted for one to two minutes</li>
                    <li>They’re able to understand and follow simple instructions</li>
                    <li>They can communicate & let you know when they need ‘to go’</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Social and emotional signs of readiness</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Demonstrates independence and a desire to complete tasks on their own – starting to say ‘no’ or ‘I can do it’ might become the norm!</li>
                    <li>They start to copy or imitate your behaviour or other around you– for example, they want to start using the toilet because you do, or wear undies because their older sibling wears them</li>
                    <li>They show a desire to please & respond well to being praise</li>
                    <li>They asks to wear real undies or use the toilet</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Reasons to hold off on toilet training</h5>
                  <p>Toilet Training is a big milestone and a big skill for little kids to learn, so starting when there are other changes or stresses happening can make the process harder. Waiting until things are calm will ensure the potty training process will be a more pleasant – and successful – one for everyone involved. Here are some examples of when it might be best to wait:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The birth of a new sibling - if you’ve got another baby on the way, it can be tempting to start potty training so they’re out of nappies before the new one arrives. If they’re showing some signs of readiness then getting started while you can focus your complete attention on them is a great idea, . otherwise waiting until they’re ready will ensure the process is quicker and easier</li>
                    <li>Starting day-care or pre-school – while there might be pressure from them to potty train your child, if they’re not ready its unlikely to be successful</li>
                    <li>Illness</li>
                  </ul>

                <p class="front-cnt">Toilet vs. Potty? How to prepare for the big day including a handy shopping list of toilet training essentials.</p>
                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <h5>Great news, it’s time to start!</h5>
                  <p>So you’ve taken the <a class="sample-btn de-btn" href="#r-quiz">Toilet Training readiness quiz</a><a class="sample-btn mo-btn" href="#r-quiz-mb">Toilet Training readiness quiz</a> and great news, you’re ready to start officially toilet training!  This is an exciting time for both of you, as your child makes the transition from baby to “big kid”!</p>
                  <p>Preparation is everything, so before kicking off, here is a list of simple tasks to accomplish, plus a handy shopping list of essentials.</p>
                  <h5>Toilet vs. potty</h5>
                  <p>One of the first things you’ll need to consider is whether you’ll use a potty or a toilet training seat. Ultimately it’s up to what both you and your toddler feel comfortable with.</p>
                  <p><strong>Toilet training seats: </strong>These are a smaller seat which attaches to the real toilet which helps to stops little bottoms from slipping in, and are great for kids who want to use the toilet just like their parents. There’s less mess to clean up and it’s generally easier using public toilets when you’re out if your child is already used to the ‘real deal’. If you decide to go with a toilet training seat, you’ll need to buy a step to help them reach the toilet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Potties: </strong>Some children develop a fear of the toilet and may be best suited to a potty initially. It’s a great idea to let them choose their own potty – this gives them a feeling of being an important part of something exciting and new and they’re more likely to want to use something they picked out themselves. As potties are much more portable, you’re able to move them into areas they can be clearly seen and accessed and you can take them out and about with you.  Of course, they do take a little extra effort to clean, but it’s certainly nothing you can’t handle after years of nappy changing!</p>
                  <h5>Are you ready? Things to do before the ‘big day’</h5>
                  <p>Preparation is key, so it’s important for you to make sure you’re ready for the start of toilet training when your child is. Here are a bunch of things to consider:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Open bathroom policy: You’re probably used to having zero privacy with a toddler around. Take the opportunity to turn this into a learning experience when you visit the loo. Let them watch you go to the toilet. Explain to them what you’re doing, right through to wiping, flushing, and washing your hands. If they’re comfortable with it, you can even let them flush for you so they get used to the sound and the splashing.</li>
                    <li>Warm ups: Make sure they have words for everything you might need to discuss throughout the toilet training process, e.g. wee, poo, potty, and that feeling they get when they feel the urge to use the toilet.</li>
                    <li>Introduce the potty: Let them familiarise themselves with their potty (ideally the one they chose!) before they start using it. Encourage them to sit on it fully clothed to get used to it, use it as a chair, or even put their dolls or teddy bears on it so you can demonstrate how it’s done.</li>
                    <li>Story Time: Explain toilet training to your child and why we need to wee and poo. There are plenty of books you can read to them, which are specifically written for children about to start toilet training.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Toilet training shopping list</h5>
                  <p>Prepare for the toilet training adventure with this list of helpful items.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training pants: </strong> These are a great option to help your kid transition from nappies to real underwear as they’re specifically designed to help them understand the difference between wet and dry, with enough absorbency where girls and boys need it most to catch regular accidents. Show your little learner how they’ll be able to pull them up and down, just like real undies, and let them pick out their favourite character to wear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Potty or toilet training seat?: </strong> Use whichever method you and your child feel most comfortable with – you even may want to experiment with both!</li>
                    <li><strong>Pants with elastic waists: </strong> Clothes that are easy for your toddler to remove are essential while toilet training. Avoid anything with buttons, zips, or drawstrings and stick with elastic. The more your child can control the process, including getting dressed and undressed, the better.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward chart and prizes: </strong> Kids respond well to positive encouragement, so a rewards chart can help them to track their accomplishments. <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">Download the free Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Reward Chart</a> and arm yourself with stickers, colouring books, toys or their favourite treats Knowing their ‘currency’ and what motivates them will help make the process easier.</li>

                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <p>So you’ve done everything you can to <a class="sample-btn" href="#r-quiz">prepare for toilet training</a> and now the big day has arrived! Hoorah! Mark this big occasion with the introduction of <a href="#boys-block">Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants</a> in their favourite design, and bring out the potty or toilet training seat which you’ve picked out together. With a positive outlook and a little creativity, toilet training can be about fun and quality time. Activities like decorating their potty with stickers, picking out rewards or creating a special progress chart together can make it fun and interesting right from the start.</p>
                  <h5>How long does toilet training take?</h5>
                  <p>There’s no set answer to this question, as every child is different, but typically it will take anywhere from three to six months until they’re fully trained with no accidents during the day. While some kids will master it within a week, others will take a little longer - remember it’s not a race. Every child will get there in the end and that’s the most important thing.</p>
                  <h5>Set aside plenty of time!</h5>
                  <p>Schedule toilet training kick off on a day where you have absolutely no other plans. It’s best if you have the following couple of days available, too. You’ll need to be on potty watch for the whole day, guiding your toddler through this new phase.</p>
                  <h5>Go! Day one in a nutshell</h5>
                  <p>Follow these simple steps and hopefully you’ll have made some good progress by bed time.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>When your child wakes up, re-explain toilet training again and what your plan for the day is (remember to mention the rewards they’ll get when they wee in the potty!)</li>
                    <li>Have them sit on the potty first thing. Hopefully they’ll be able to wee and kick off the day in high spirits</li>
                    <li>Let them show their independence by pulling on their Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants in the favourite design by themselves</li>
                    <li>Throughout the day, pay close attention to your child’s behaviour and facial expressions to see if they need to use the bathroom. Many kids haven’t worked out when they need to wee or poo by the first day and you’ll need to guide them to the potty at first</li>
                    <li>Keep the water flowing all day so they wee regularly and can fit in more potty practice</li>
                    <li>When you need to use the bathroom, let them accompany you so they can watch -  explain what you’re doing as you go including flushing and washing your hands</li>
                    <li>Play lots of games throughout the day to keep them entertained</li>
                    <li>Make sure they use the potty right before bed</li>
                    <li>If they have an accident, don’t get upset with them, but let them know in an encouraging tone that wee is for the potty. For example, “Let’s try to make it to the potty next time!”</li>
                    <li>Remember to praise your child and/or provide a reward when they get it right. This keeps them motivated and confident.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Some tips for helping them know when to go</h5>
                  <p>Teaching your toddler to recognise the urge to go to the toilet can be tricky. Here are a few ideas to use:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Talk about times that you might recognise the urge, like after eating or having a big drink.</li>
                    <li>Make it seem like great fun to go the toilet.</li>
                    <li>Encourage your toddler to tell you what you should do if you think you need to do a wee.</li>
                    <li>Praise them for telling you their pants are wet, it’s the 1st step in recognising the urge to wee.</li>
                    <li>If they show you that they need to go to the toilet, tell them “you’ve got a wee/poo coming, let’s go to the potty”.</li>
                    <li>If they pass wind, get them to recognise the smell as a signal that a poo might be coming.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Praise and rewards</h5>
                  <p>Rewards are a great way to <u>make toilet training fun</u> and keep your child motivated right from the start. Not all prizes have to be tangible like lollies or an ice-cream – something as simple as some praise, a round of applause, a high five, or doing a potty victory dance are strong motivators for your child so make sure to make time for celebrating!</p>
                  <p>Don’t forget to <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">download the Pull-Ups rewards chart</a> so both you and your little learner’s can keep track of their achievements and progress!</p>
                  <h5>Ready, Set…. Not yet!</h5>
                  <p>If your child starts out fine but then gets stuck, don’t worry. Just stop and start again when your child appears more ready or interested in starting. Timing is very important when it comes to toilet training and it’s not unusual for the potty to go back into the closest for weeks, or even months. Toilet training is a developmental process. Children’s bodies and brains are developing all the time and each new phase sets the foundation for those to come. No amount of teaching can make those developments happen before their time, so waiting until you’re sure your child is ready will make for a happier, easier time for all!</p>

                <p class="front-cnt">Making the switch from Nappies into Training Pants is a big milestone and signals the transition from baby to big kid!</p>
                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <p>Congratulations! You and your little trainee are ready to leave nappies behind. This is a great prospect for most parents (for obvious reasons), but it’s also an exciting time for your child. Introducing Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants is a big symbolic moment in your child’s development – they’re no longer a baby, but a toddler! For them, getting promoted out of nappies is a sign that they’re growing up and becoming a big kid.</p>
                  <h5>Making the big switch: transitioning from Nappies to Training Pants</h5>
                  <p>Making the jump from nappies straight to real undies is a big step for most parents and kids. Toilet training pants, such as Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants provide a good middle ground until that time. That’s because they’ve been specially designed to allow your child to feel the difference between wet or dry, with the reassurance of absorbency to catch accidents, big or small. Plus the super soft and stretchy sides are easy for little hands to learn how to pull them up and down by themselves. Best of all, they come in a range of great Disney<sup>&reg;</sup> designs just like real undies that they’ll love to wear.</p>
                  <h5>Consistency is key</h5>
                  <p>Toilet training using both nappies and training pants can be confusing, so once it’s time to start training and take your child out of nappies, its best to keep them out. Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants are more than just a training pant; they’re also a symbol that it’s time to be a ‘big kid’ and a promise that you’re in it together and will work as a team on the toilet training journey. Here are a couple of other reasons to ditch the nappies once and for all:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style:decimal">
                    <li>Independence: Nappies are not easy for your child to take on and off. Training Pants go on just like real undies, allowing them to independently master the skill of pulling them up and down for themselves.</li>
                    <li>Learning Cues: As nappies and nappy-pants are designed to absorb, remaining in them doesn’t provide any feedback when they go to the toilet by allow them to feel the difference between wet and dry. Training Pants have a special learning liner designed to help them feel the difference so they can understand when it’s time to go to the potty.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Making the move to underwear</h5>
                  <p>When your little one has well and truly mastered the initial stages of toilet training, you can start getting them excited about their first pair of undies. Take them shopping and let them choose the ones they like best.</p>
                  <p>This final step will boost their confidence even further and you’ll find that they’ll be very motivated to keep their new underwear dry.</p>

                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <p>Have you ever rewarded yourself for a job well done? Maybe you bought a coffee instead of making it, or treated yourself to a bubble bath with no interruptions (or rubber duckies around you!) Children need rewards too, and even something little can go a long way to making them feel special. In fact, getting a reward is likely to make them want to do more of the good job which earned it.</p>
                  <h5>And keeping it interesting</h5>
                  <p>If toddlers are famous for one thing, it’s their short attention spans. They may be all revved up about toilet training one day and could completely lose interest by the next (particularly if potty visits are interrupting their more exciting activities).</p>
                  <p>Rewards and games are a great way to keep them interested as they continue to become fully trained. Learning their 'currency' or what excites them will help to keep it fun and motivate them along the journey. Remember that you don’t have to encourage your little one with unhealthy snacks or lots of toys – sometimes an outing in the park or a simple “Wow! Good job!” will be enough. A little reward can go a long way!</p>
                  <h5>Download the Pull-Ups Rewards Chart</h5>
                  <p>The Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training rewards chart is a great place to start to keep your child motivated about all of the new skills they are learning during toilet training. Simply <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">download it and print it out</a>, and together come up with a bunch of ideas of how you’ll celebrate each of these new skills that are mastered.</p>
                  <p>Not all achievements are equal, so it can be a good idea to make the rewards bigger or smaller to reflect this.</p>
                  <h5>Treats, stickers or high fives?</h5>
                  <p>Encourage your toddler’s learning by praising their efforts in toilet training. Rewards like stickers, snacks and special toys to play with while they’re on the potty are all great ways to foster their progress and reassure them if they <a href="https://www.huggies.co.nz/toddler/toilet-training/problems/regression" target="_blank">regress</a> a little bit. Toilet training praise and rewards will boost your toddler’s interest in learning how to use the toilet.</p>
                  <p>Here are some ideas that tend to work well with most kids. Remember, not all rewards have to be tangible – sometimes simple praise or a high-five will be enough to recognise your toddler’s efforts.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Colourful stickers to place on the rewards chart or even decorate their potty with</li>
                    <li>Colouring books and pencils</li>
                    <li>Reading books</li>
                    <li>Favourite snacks – you could try one for Number 1’s and two for Number 2’s</li>
                    <li>Going out for ice cream</li>
                    <li>Lego</li>
                    <li>Going to the park or beach</li>

                    <h6>Wet or dry</h6>
                    <p>Point out things around the house and ask your toddler to tell you if they’re wet or dry. This helps them get a handle on what’s happening when they feel wet.</p>
                    <h6>Bathroom steps</h6>
                    <p>Have an arts and crafts day where you and your child cut out shapes (e.g. monster footprints or animal paws) marking a path to the bathroom. When kids start toilet training it’s easy for them to forget the way to the potty in the heat of the moment.</p>
                    <!--<h6>Magic water</h6>
                    <p>Add a few drops of food colouring to your toilet bowl and watch your child’s amazement as the water changes colour when they wee!</p>-->
                    <h6>Treasure chest</h6>
                    <p>Make a treasure chest to store your child’s potty gear – containing everything they’ll want on hand to help them learn plus ‘treasures’ to reward them for a job well done. Find a box with a lid which flaps open, like a real treasure chest and together with your toddler, decorate it and write on their name. Now it’s time to fill it with treasures – stickers, storybooks, small musical instruments like a harmonica or bells, a stuffed animal, finger puppets, bubbles, small treats and of-course, Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants featuring their favourite character.</p>

                <div class="item_detail_info"> 
                  <!--  <h5>Top tips for toilet training boys</h5> -->
                  <p>Toilet training boys can seem like a particularly daunting task. Do you start him standing or sitting? When should you expect results? How important is a male role model? When looking for the answers it’s important to remember that every child progresses through toilet training at a different pace and there is no right or wrong way. Boys tend to take a few months longer than girls on average but that’s nothing to worry about. One thing is certain though, making the process fun and rewarding will help you and your little boy to succeed.</p>
                  <h5>A step-by-step guide</h5>
                  <p>Here are some key <a href="./docs/pull-ups-toilet-training-guide.pdf" target="_blank">toilet training steps</a> you and your little man can take to help kick things off smoothly:</p>
                  <h5>Toilet training seat or potty?</h5>
                  <p>It’s ultimately up to you to decide what both you and your child feel comfortable using, but often it can be a good idea to start toilet training with a potty. Children’s potties are easy for little ones to hop on and off and they are conveniently portable. “Big toilets” can seem a bit daunting at first. Eliminating nerves is a key for encouraging children to adopt new habits. Allowing her to pick out her own potty can make the transition even smoother.</p>
                  <h5>Sitting vs. standing</h5>
                  <p>Some little boys find standing up to wee quite scary at first, so if this is the case simply start sitting down. On the other hand, your son may have no problems at all, especially if he’s trying to copy the male role models in his life! It goes without saying though that you can expect a lot more mess if you kick off with standing!</p>
                  <h5>Show him how it’s done</h5>
                  <p>Little boys love to be just like their dad or big brother, and learn a lot by imitating people around them, so watching another male sitting on, or standing up at the toilet is a great way for them to see how it’s done. This is also a great way to help him gain the confidence to try it for himself. Don’t worry if there are no suitable male role models around when he’s ready to start toilet training – just show him sitting down and he can learn to stand up later on.</p>
                  <h5>Be patient</h5>
                  <p>Toilet training is a big change for little boys and it’s not a race. Accidents happen and it’s important to try and stay positive throughout the process. If your son is snubbing his potty, try not to push him. He will come around when he is ready.</p>
                  <h5>Use Huggies Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants for “big boys”</h5>
                  <p>Pick up some Huggies Pull-Ups for boys at the supermarket to help guide him through the toilet training process. They’ve been specifically designed to help him learn the most important parts of toilet training, including pulling up & down and the difference between wet from dry. Plus, they’ve got fun Disney Toy Story and Cars designs on them which we’re sure he’ll love.</p>
                  <h5>Here are some ways to help make toilet training a fun experience for your little boy:</h5>
                  <h6>Aiming for a target can be fun!</h6>
                  <p>Some boys have great success with this handy little device. Simply place it in the potty and get your little one to aim for the target. It will keep them focused on the middle of the bowl and will hopefully mean less mess for you to mop up!</p>

                </a>
                <p class="front-cnt">Teaching good potty habits from the start, like wiping front to back, are the keys to success</p>
                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <p>If your daughter has been displaying signs of readiness for toilet training, it’s a great time to get started. For some girls toilet training will be a breeze. For others it can feel like a bit of a rollercoaster ride. In general, girls tend to pick up toilet training quicker than boys. However, if your daughter struggles with toilet training, remember to support her and give her lots of positive encouragement. Every child progresses with toilet training at a unique pace.</p>
                  <h5>A step-by-step guide</h5>
                  <p>Here are some key <a href="./docs/pull-ups-toilet-training-guide.pdf" target="_blank">toilet training steps</a> you and your little girl can take to help kick things off smoothly:</p>
                  <h5>Toilet training seat or potty?</h5>
                  <p>It’s ultimately up to you to decide what both you and your child feel comfortable using, but often it can be a good idea to start toilet training with a potty. Children’s potties are easy for little ones to hop on and off and they are conveniently portable. “Big toilets” can seem a bit daunting at first. Eliminating nerves is a key for encouraging children to adopt new habits. Allowing her to pick out her own potty can make the transition even smoother. </p>
                  <h5>Teach by example</h5>
                  <p>Kids love imitating their parents, which is very convenient when you’re trying to teach them something! Let your daughter watch you on the toilet so she can see how it’s done. Explain about wiping, flushing, and washing hands as you go. Once she has watched you a few times she’ll be excited to try it for herself. Imitation is one of the most common ways that toddlers learn new skills.</p>
                  <h5>Get some potty-friendly clothes</h5>
                  <p>Clothing for girls tends to be a little more complex than clothing for boys. Buttons, frills, flowy skirts and dresses, and delicate materials, such as lace, are not ideal during the toilet training phase. Your daughter will need clothing that can be removed quickly and easily while she’s still learning to make it to the potty in time. Pants with elastic waists are the way to go!</p>
                  <h5>Use Huggies Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants for “big girls”</h5>
                  <p>Getting out of nappies and into “Big Girl” undies is a big step for little girls. Pick up some Huggies Pull-Ups for girls at the supermarket to help guide her through the toilet training process. They’ve been specifically designed to help her learn the most important parts of toilet training, including pulling up & down and the difference between wet from dry. Plus, the pretty Disney Princess designs will help her look and feel every bit like the “Big Kid” she wants to be.</p>
                  <h5>Let her learn from her mistakes</h5>
                  <p>It’s not unusual for girls to want to wee standing up if they’ve watched their dad or older brothers using this method. It’s best to give kids as much independence as possible while they’re toilet training, so let her try standing up. She’ll realise straight away that this technique doesn’t work for her, and coming to the decision herself will give her more confidence than if you vetoed it from the start.</p>
                  <h5>Here are some ways to help make toilet training a fun experience for your little girl:</h5>
                  <h6>Pretty stickers to reward a job well done</h6>
                  <p>Download the FREE <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">Huggies Pull-Ups reward chart</a> and buy some pretty stickers to track her toilet training progress. Explain to her that every time she achieves something, e.g. making it to the potty in time, doing a poo without your help, she can get a reward. Stickers, books, colouring pencils, Lego, and favourite snacks make good prizes, so make sure you’ve always got something on hand.</p>
                  <h6>Take her shopping for big girl underwear</h6>
                  <p>Get your daughter excited for a shopping trip to buy big girl undies. Letting her pick some pairs with her favourite characters will keep her motivated to make it to the toilet.</p>

                  <!-- <h5>Get the basics right - Building a toilet training routine</h5> -->
                  <p>Once you kick things off with toilet training, try and work everything that you and your child do into a routine. This isn’t always so easy, as children’s bladders and bowels don’t always act according to plan! Get a grasp of how many times your child needs to go to the toilet in a day and when, and try to approach toilet training based on what you’ve learned about this behaviour.. Your child might be displaying all the signs of readiness, but it will still take some time before they fully recognise the physical urge to use the bathroom and know that they then need to make their way to the potty.</p>
                  <p>A consistent routine will build your child’s confidence as they will know exactly what to do, where to go and how to do it. Consistency and repetition helps them feel in control of the situation, and what’s coming up next. We’ve got a few tips here to help you build your toilet training routine.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h5>The 4 Musts</h5>
                  <p>Child development expert, Dr. Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett has 4 musts for toilet training. Keep these in mind and you’re headed for toilet training success!</p>
                  <h5>Let your child set the pace</h5>
                  <p>Trust your child, and let them set the pace. Don’t try to force them to learn too fast. Support them with the encouragement and positive feedback they need.</p>
                  <h5>Be Positive</h5>
                  <p>When accidents do arise, which they inevitably will, say ‘you’ll do better next time’ or ‘don’t worry about the accident, we’ll get it right soon to keep building confidence and encourage those “big kid” feelings.</p>
                  <h5>Be Consistent</h5>
                  <p>Avoid mixed signals. Switching back and forth to nappies is confusing to a child. Once you make the switch to training pants, stick with it. Wearing training pants makes your child feel like a ‘big girl’ or ‘big boy’.</p>
                  <h5>Be Patient</h5>
                  <p>There will be accidents! But mistakes are what we learn from. There may be times when your child seems like they are regressing. Don’t get discouraged – this is perfectly normal. Be confident that things will be back on track in no time.</p>
                  <h5>Stop! It’s Potty Time</h5>
                  <p>Successful toilet training occurs when your child can identify the physical urge to use the bathroom. Up until this point, a potty routine is necessary and will help your child get into the swing of things. Try the following schedule at first and then let your child run the show once they get the hang of it. It’s a good idea to take your child to the potty at the following times to help them get into a routine:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>When they wake up</li>
                    <li>An hour after a big drink</li>
                    <li>Before naps</li>
                    <li>After naps</li>
                    <li>Before meals</li>
                    <li>Before bed</li>
                    <li>If they wake up in the middle of the night</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Weeing on demand isn’t easy for any of us, so if they’re having trouble getting started, try reading to them while they’re on the potty to help them relax, or run the tap (it’s hard to not want to wee when you hear the sound of running water!). If they really don’t need to go, that’s fine, too. Simply ask them if they need to wee a couple of times before your next scheduled stop.</p>
                  <h5>Squeaky clean: Don’t forget to wipe & wash!</h5>
                  <p>Proper wiping and hand washing is a really important part of the toilet training routine, just as important as the potty visits themselves, so Teaching your child the right hygiene is important.</p>
                  <p><strong>Wiping:</strong> After doing a ‘number two’, like a big kid, teach them that they need to wipe themselves clean, and keep wiping until it comes back clean. </p>
                  <p><strong>Washing:</strong> Show your toddler how to wet their hands, apply soap and rub their hands together for long enough to cover all of their hands, rinse clean, and dry! The more you let them practice themselves, the better they will become at learning this new skill.</p>
                  <p class="text-xs-center"> <img src="./images/wash-your-hands.png" alt="wash-your-hands" title="Wash Your Hands"/> </p>
                  <h5>Get everyone else on board</h5>
                  <p>It’s not likely that you’ll be around for every moment of your child’s toilet training journey, which is why it’s essential to get all other carers up to speed with the routine. Inform their day care, grandparents, babysitters, and anyone else who spends time alone with your toddler.</p>

                <p class="front-cnt">Night time dryness is a whole different ball game to the day, and will come in time when their bladder & brain sync</p>
                <div class="item_detail_info">
                  <h5>Setting the facts straight</h5>
                  <p>There are many misconceptions about achieving day-time and night-time dryness in children, and understanding when a child is fully toilet trained. Many parents find that day time toilet training is a piece of cake compared to night time, and believe a similar process can be taught to prevent bedwetting but that’s not the case. That’s because it has nothing to do with your child as an individual, rather everything to do with the fact that lots of children simply haven’t developed the bladder capacity to hold urine over an entire night.</p>
                  <p>Night time dryness will typically come when your child’s bladder has developed enough to hold urine overnight, or when your child starts waking up to their body’s signal that they need to wee. Becoming dry at night can take anywhere from a few weeks or months to a few years and varies with each child. In fact at age 4, 25% of kids who are dry during the day will still be wetting the bed at night. Dry nights come with time and patience, and attempting to train your child out of bedwetting will only create unnecessary stress.</p>
                  <h5>Are rewards effective at night to train them to stay dry?</h5>
                  <p>Rewards systems are a great idea when your child is day time training. This is because when they’re awake they’re fully conscious and able to recognise and control when they need to use the potty. But night time is a whole different ball game, as when they’re asleep their bladder is out of their conscious control. </p>
                  <p>Imagine being offered $1,000,000 to stop snoring – no matter how much you want the money, you will continue to snore at night - the only way to stop yourself would be to stay awake! The same goes for bedwetting. There’s no harm in some gentle praise for a dry night, but don’t go overboard or heavily reward it, as it can make your toddler feel like a failure when they do happen to wet the bed and can actually do more damage their self-esteem.</p>
                  <h5>What about punishment, will that work?</h5>
                  <p>Be patient and reassuring and keep a positive attitude - it’s not a big deal to achieve dryness at night until the child is older. Yelling at, or punishing, the child for wetting the bed will only cause setbacks and in the meantime, do more damage to their self-esteem.</p>
                  <h5>So how do you handle it?</h5>
                  <p>The fact that they wet the bed is not something to be overly concerned about, because they’ll grow out of it as their body matures. Nighttime wetting can leave a child feeling embarrassed and upset because they can’t stay dry through the night, so the best thing to do is reinforce that it is not their fault by telling them they cannot stay dry through the night because their body hasn't matured yet and it is not a choice they make. Responding negatively to your child’s wetting can damage self-esteem and even prolong wetting. </p>
                  <h5>Setting up a bedtime routine</h5>
                  <p>Establishing a bedtime routine will help your little learner settle into a pattern, which will hopefully lead to consistently dry nights.</p>

                  <h5>Night time tips</h5>
                  <p>Try these tips to help with night-time bladder control:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep drinking water:</strong> While winding down fluids before bed is not harmful, limiting water intake too much can cause dehydration and constipation. It’s a good idea however to limit fizzy or sugary drinks after 5pm</li>
                    <li><strong>Take a trip to the bathroom before bed:</strong> This is a really important step in any bedtime routine</li>
                    <li><strong>Relocate the potty at night: </strong>A good idea is to place the potty near your child’s bed in case they wake in the night and need to wee. Young children can be scared of the dark so a small night light can ease their fears.</li>
                    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.huggies.com.au/nappies/drynites"><strong>Use Huggies DryNites Pyjama Pants at night:</strong></a> Before going all the way with undies, transition with Huggies DryNites. They’re designed to fit and feel more like real undies and come in great big kid designs to help give your child confidence and independence, while providing a safety net for any accidents</li>
                    <li><strong>Buy a mattress protector:</strong> Once you have transitioned to underwear at night, invest in a mattress protector to protect against any night –time accidents resulting in wet sheets</li>
                    <li><strong>Give ‘lifting’ a miss:</strong> Lifting a child out of their bed in the middle of the night and placing them on the toilet was once a very popular technique and while it’s a great idea to reduce the number of wet beds, it does not help to train the bladder to store more, nor does it teach children to wake on their own when the bladder sends signals to the brain telling them to wake up and go to the toilet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buy easy-to-remove pyjamas:</strong> Make sure your little one can easily remove their PJs to wee in the middle of the night. Avoid any complicated buttons or frills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Try not to get visibly upset if your child wets the bed. Remember that they can’t control the situation right now. </li>
                    <li><strong>Morning routine:</strong> Encourage your child to go to the toilet as soon as they wake-up in the morning. This will help put the bladder on a schedule.</li>

                  <h5>Confused about the best product to use for Toilet Training?</h5>
                  <p>Heard from your friends that Nappy-Pants are great for toilet training as they’re easy to pull up and down? Or that Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants are the best option to help your little one learn? Preparation ,and using the right tools, is everything to help your little learner make the big leap from baby to big kid!</p>
                  <h5>The overview: Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants vs. Nappy-Pants</h5>
                  <p>You’ll already be aware that both of these products slide on like underwear. However, that’s pretty much where the similarities end.</p>
                  <h5 class="pink-title">What are Nappy-Pants for?</h5>
                  <p>Nappy-Pants are designed for active babies who can’t sit still for a nappy change. You can pull on Nappy-Pants while your little one is standing up, making them perfect for squirmy bubs who would rather spend their time running about the house. Nappy-Pants have the same absorbency as a regular nappy and they look and feel just like regular nappies, too.</p>
                  <h5 class="pink-title">What are Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants for?</h5>
                  <p>Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants are designed specifically for toddlers who are ready to start toilet training and make the transition from nappies to big kid undies. They’re made to look and feel like real undies with great Disney designs, and are easy to practice pulling up and down, just like real undies. The most important feature is the Learning Liner, designed to teach your child the difference between wet and dry by giving them feedback, or the sensation of wetness, when they’ve gone to the toilet in their pants. Regular nappies and nappy-pants don’t do this as they’re designed to quickly absorb and keep the inside dry. </p>
                  <h5>What is the Learning Liner?</h5>
                  <p>Pull-Ups have a unique learning liner that will help your child tell the difference between wet and dry. When your child starts to wee inside Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup>Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants, the liner allows the feeling of wetness for a few minutes, giving your toddler enough time to register the sensation of wetness and be reminded that now is the ideal time for a potty visit!</p>

                  <h4>Get Ready- When should you start toilet training?</h4>
                  <div class="item_detail_info">
                    <p>As your baby grows into an active toddler on their way to becoming a “Big Kid”, you’ll most likely start wondering when you can finally ditch the nappies for undies. Toilet training is an exciting and rewarding time, and one that will be different for every child. While some kids will  master the potty in no time, others can take a little longer.</p>
                    <p>One of the keys to successful toilet training is timing – the more ready your child is the smoother the process will be.</p>
                    <h5>The best age to start toilet training</h5>
                    <p>There is no magic or “correct” age to kick off toilet training. The truth is that no two children train alike, so the secret to success in toilet training is to tune into your child’s unique learning style and waiting for them to display the signs of being ready. </p>
                    <p>The majority of  children will be physically, mentally and emotionally ready to start between the ages of 18 months and three years (though most haven’t mastered the readiness skills until after their 2nd birthday). So rather than simply working on the assumption that there is a certain ‘right age’ to start toilet training, ensuring that your toddler recognises the urge to wee or poo and acts on the impulse is an important sign that they’re ready to start training.</p>
                    <p>Understandably, you’ll be looking forward to being done with nappies, but pressuring them to start before this point will not be productive and will only drag out the process. <a href="#girls-block">Girls</a> tend to be ‘ready’ a little earlier than <a href="#boys-block">boys</a>, so don’t fret if your little man is taking a bit longer to get started than his female peers – every child is unique and no two children train alike.</p>
                    <h5>Signs of readiness for toilet training</h5>
                    <p>Feel free to start <a class="sample-btn" href="#r-quiz">preparing for toilet training</a> once you notice a few physical, mental, and social signs. It’s up to you to help your toddler understand the connection between their wiggling, leg crossing or crotch grabbing, and their need to go to the toilet or potty!</p>
                    <h5>Physical signs of readiness</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>They stay dry for up to two hours and/or stay dry through naps – this shows that their bladder capacity and control are improving</li>
                      <li>They have fairly predictable bowel movements and regular, formed poos</li>
                      <li>They have the dexterity to pull their pants up and down</li>
                      <li>They can walk steadily and without assistance – so they can get to the toilet by themselves!</li>
                      <li>They recognise the urge to go – you might notice some common signals like they now go off to a secret corner to poo or dance or wiggle around on the spot, grasp at their crotch or show funny facial expressions when they need to wee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Mental signs of readiness</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>They know what wee and poo are and may talk about them when you change their nappy</li>
                      <li>They ask to be changed or complain about a dirty nappy – they may even start to remove it themselves after a wee!</li>
                      <li>They can sit still without being distracted for one to two minutes</li>
                      <li>They’re able to understand and follow simple instructions</li>
                      <li>They can communicate & let you know when they need ‘to go’</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Social and emotional signs of readiness</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Demonstrates independence and a desire to complete tasks on their own – starting to say ‘no’ or ‘I can do it’ might become the norm!</li>
                      <li>They start to copy or imitate your behaviour or other around you– for example, they want to start using the toilet because you do, or wear undies because their older sibling wears them</li>
                      <li>They show a desire to please & respond well to being praise</li>
                      <li>They asks to wear real undies or use the toilet</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Reasons to hold off on toilet training</h5>
                    <p>Toilet Training is a big milestone and a big skill for little kids to learn, so starting when there are other changes or stresses happening can make the process harder. Waiting until things are calm will ensure the potty training process will be a more pleasant – and successful – one for everyone involved. Here are some examples of when it might be best to wait:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The birth of a new sibling - if you’ve got another baby on the way, it can be tempting to start potty training so they’re out of nappies before the new one arrives. If they’re showing some signs of readiness then getting started while you can focus your complete attention on them is a great idea, . otherwise waiting until they’re ready will ensure the process is quicker and easier</li>
                      <li>Starting day-care or pre-school – while there might be pressure from them to potty train your child, if they’re not ready its unlikely to be successful</li>
                      <li>Illness</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Great news, it’s time to start!</h5>
                    <p>So you’ve taken the <a class="sample-btn" href="#r-quiz">Toilet Training readiness quiz</a> and great news, you’re ready to start officially toilet training!  This is an exciting time for both of you, as your child make the transition from baby to “big kid”!</p>
                    <p>Preparation is everything, so before kicking off, here is a list of simple tasks to accomplish, plus a handy shopping list of essentials.</p>
                    <h5>Toilet vs. potty</h5>
                    <p>One of the first things you’ll need to consider is whether you’ll use a potty or a toilet training seat. Ultimately it’s up to what both you and your toddler feel comfortable with.</p>
                    <p><strong>Toilet training seats: </strong>These are a smaller seat which attaches to the real toilet which helps to stops little bottoms from slipping in, and are great for kids who want to use the toilet just like their parents. There’s less mess to clean up and it’s generally easier using public toilets when you’re out if your child is already used to the ‘real deal’. If you decide to go with a toilet training seat, you’ll need to buy a step to help them reach the toilet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potties: </strong>Some children develop a fear of the toilet and may be best suited to a potty initially. It’s a great idea to let them choose their own potty – this gives them a feeling of being an important part of something exciting and new and they’re more likely to want to use something they picked out themselves. As potties are much more portable, you’re able to move them into areas they can be clearly seen and accessed and you can take them out and about with you.  Of course, they do take a little extra effort to clean, but it’s certainly nothing you can’t handle after years of nappy changing!</p>
                    <h5>Are you ready? Things to do before the ‘big day’</h5>
                    <p>Preparation is key, so it’s important for you to make sure you’re ready for the start of toilet training when your child is. Here are a bunch of things to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Open bathroom policy: You’re probably used to having zero privacy with a toddler around. Take the opportunity to turn this into a learning experience when you visit the loo. Let them watch you go to the toilet. Explain to them what you’re doing, right through to wiping, flushing, and washing your hands. If they’re comfortable with it, you can even let them flush for you so they get used to the sound and the splashing.</li>
                      <li>Warm ups: Make sure they have words for everything you might need to discuss throughout the toilet training process, e.g. wee, poo, potty, and that feeling they get when they feel the urge to use the toilet.</li>
                      <li>Introduce the potty: Let them familiarise themselves with their potty (ideally the one they chose!) before they start using it. Encourage them to sit on it fully clothed to get used to it, use it as a chair, or even put their dolls or teddy bears on it so you can demonstrate how it’s done.</li>
                      <li>Story Time: Explain toilet training to your child and why we need to wee and poo. There are plenty of books you can read to them, which are specifically written for children about to start toilet training.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Toilet training shopping list</h5>
                    <p>Prepare for the toilet training adventure with this list of helpful items.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training pants: </strong> These are a great option to help your kid transition from nappies to real underwear as they’re specifically designed to help them understand the difference between wet and dry, with enough absorbency where girls and boys need it most to catch regular accidents. Show your little learner how they’ll be able to pull them up and down, just like real undies, and let them pick out their favourite character to wear.</li>
                      <li><strong>Potty or toilet training seat?: </strong> Use whichever method you and your child feel most comfortable with – you even may want to experiment with both!</li>
                      <li><strong>Pants with elastic waists: </strong> Clothes that are easy for your toddler to remove are essential while toilet training. Avoid anything with buttons, zips, or drawstrings and stick with elastic. The more your child can control the process, including getting dressed and undressed, the better.</li>
                      <li><strong>Reward chart and prizes: </strong> Kids respond well to positive encouragement, so a rewards chart can help them to track their accomplishments. <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">Download the free Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Reward Chart</a> and arm yourself with stickers, colouring books, toys or their favourite treats Knowing their ‘currency’ and what motivates them will help make the process easier.</li>

Activities like decorating their potty with stickers, picking out rewards or creating a special progress chart together can make it fun and interesting right from the start.</p>
                    <h5>How long does toilet training take?</h5>
                    <p>There’s no set answer to this question, as every child is different, but typically it will take anywhere from three to six months until they’re fully trained with no accidents during the day. While some kids will master it within a week, others will take a little longer - remember it’s not a race. Every child will get there in the end and that’s the most important thing.</p>
                    <h5>Set aside plenty of time!</h5>
                    <p>Schedule toilet training kick off on a day where you have absolutely no other plans. It’s best if you have the following couple of days available, too. You’ll need to be on potty watch for the whole day, guiding your toddler through this new phase.</p>
                    <h5>Go! Day one in a nutshell</h5>
                    <p>Follow these simple steps and hopefully you’ll have made some good progress by bed time.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>When your child wakes up, re-explain toilet training again and what your plan for the day is (remember to mention the rewards they’ll get when they wee in the potty!)</li>
                      <li>Have them sit on the potty first thing. Hopefully they’ll be able to wee and kick off the day in high spirits</li>
                      <li>Let them show their independence by pulling on their Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants in the favourite design by themselves</li>
                      <li>Throughout the day, pay close attention to your child’s behaviour and facial expressions to see if they need to use the bathroom. Many kids haven’t worked out when they need to wee or poo by the first day and you’ll need to guide them to the potty at first</li>
                      <li>Keep the water flowing all day so they wee regularly and can fit in more potty practice</li>
                      <li>When you need to use the bathroom, let them accompany you so they can watch -  explain what you’re doing as you go including flushing and washing your hands</li>
                      <li>Play lots of games throughout the day to keep them entertained</li>
                      <li>Make sure they use the potty right before bed</li>
                      <li>If they have an accident, don’t get upset with them, but let them know in an encouraging tone that wee is for the potty. For example, “Let’s try to make it to the potty next time!”</li>
                      <li>Remember to praise your child and/or provide a reward when they get it right. This keeps them motivated and confident.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Some tips for helping them know when to go</h5>
                    <p>Teaching your toddler to recognise the urge to go to the toilet can be tricky. Here are a few ideas to use:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Talk about times that you might recognise the urge, like after eating or having a big drink.</li>
                      <li>Make it seem like great fun to go the toilet.</li>
                      <li>Encourage your toddler to tell you what you should do if you think you need to do a wee.</li>
                      <li>Praise them for telling you their pants are wet, it’s the 1st step in recognising the urge to wee.</li>
                      <li>If they show you that they need to go to the toilet, tell them “you’ve got a wee/poo coming, let’s go to the potty”.</li>
                      <li>If they pass wind, get them to recognise the smell as a signal that a poo might be coming.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Praise and rewards</h5>
                    <p>Rewards are a great way to <a class="sample-btn" href="#r-quiz">make toilet training fun</a> and keep your child motivated right from the start. Not all prizes have to be tangible like lollies or an ice-cream – something as simple as some praise, a round of applause, a high five, or doing a potty victory dance are strong motivators for your child so make sure to make time for celebrating!</p>
                    <p>Don’t forget to <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">download the Pull-Ups rewards chart</a> so both you and your little learner’s can keep track of their achievements and progress!</p>
                    <h5>Ready, Set…. Not yet!</h5>
                    <p>If your child starts out fine but then gets stuck, don’t worry. Just stop and start again when your child appears more ready or interested in starting. Timing is very important when it comes to toilet training and it’s not unusual for the potty to go back into the closest for weeks, or even months. Toilet training is a developmental process. Children’s bodies and brains are developing all the time and each new phase sets the foundation for those to come. No amount of teaching can make those developments happen before their time, so waiting until you’re sure your child is ready will make for a happier, easier time for all!</p>

                  <h4>Say goodbye to nappies!</h4>
                  <div class="item_detail_info">
                    <p>Congratulations! You and your little trainee are ready to leave nappies behind. This is a great prospect for most parents (for obvious reasons), but it’s also an exciting time for your child. Introducing Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants is a big symbolic moment in your child’s development – they’re no longer a baby, but a toddler! For them, getting promoted out of nappies is a sign that they’re growing up and becoming a big kid.</p>
                    <h5>Making the big switch: transitioning from Nappies to Training Pants</h5>
                    <p>Making the jump from nappies straight to real undies is a big step for most parents and kids. Toilet training pants, such as Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants provide a good middle ground until that time. That’s because they’ve been specially designed to allow your child to feel the difference between wet or dry, with the reassurance of absorbency to catch accidents, big or small. Plus the super soft and stretchy sides are easy for little hands to learn how to pull them up and down by themselves. Best of all, they come in a range of great Disney<sup>&reg;</sup> designs just like real undies that they’ll love to wear.</p>
                    <h5>Consistency is key</h5>
                    <p>Toilet training using both nappies and training pants can be confusing, so once it’s time to start training and take your child out of nappies, its best to keep them out. Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants are more than just a training pant; they’re also a symbol that it’s time to be a ‘big kid’ and a promise that you’re in it together and will work as a team on the toilet training journey. Here are a couple of other reasons to ditch the nappies once and for all:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style:decimal">
                      <li>Independence: Nappies are not easy for your child to take on and off. Training Pants go on just like real undies, allowing them to independently master the skill of pulling them up and down for themselves.</li>
                      <li>Learning Cues: As nappies and nappy-pants are designed to absorb, remaining in them doesn’t provide any feedback when they go to the toilet by allow them to feel the difference between wet and dry. Training Pants have a special learning liner designed to help them feel the difference so they can understand when it’s time to go to the potty.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Making the move to underwear</h5>
                    <p>When your little one has well and truly mastered the initial stages of toilet training, you can start getting them excited about their first pair of undies. Take them shopping and let them choose the ones they like best.</p>
                    <p>This final step will boost their confidence even further and you’ll find that they’ll be very motivated to keep their new underwear dry.</p>

                  <h4>Some great games to play</h4>
                  <div class="item_detail_info">
                    <p>Have you ever rewarded yourself for a job well done? Maybe you bought a coffee instead of making it, or treated yourself to a bubble bath with no interruptions (or rubber duckies around you!) Children need rewards too, and even something little can go a long way to making them feel special. In fact, getting a reward is likely to make them want to do more of the good job which earned it.</p>
                    <h5>And keeping it interesting</h5>
                    <p>If toddlers are famous for one thing, it’s their short attention spans. They may be all revved up about toilet training one day and could completely lose interest by the next (particularly if potty visits are interrupting their more exciting activities).</p>
                    <p>Rewards and games are a great way to keep them interested as they continue to become fully trained. Learning their 'currency' or what excites them will help to keep it fun and motivate them along the journey. Remember that you don’t have to encourage your little one with unhealthy snacks or lots of toys – sometimes an outing in the park or a simple “Wow! Good job!” will be enough. A little reward can go a long way!</p>
                    <h5>Download the Pull-Ups Rewards Chart</h5>
                    <p>The Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training rewards chart is a great place to start to keep your child motivated about all of the new skills they are learning during toilet training. Simply <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">download it and print it out</a>, and together come up with a bunch of ideas of how you’ll celebrate each of these new skills that are mastered.</p>
                    <p>Not all achievements are equal, so it can be a good idea to make the rewards bigger or smaller to reflect this.</p>
                    <h5>Treats, stickers or high fives?</h5>
                    <p>Encourage your toddler’s learning by praising their efforts in toilet training. Rewards like stickers, snacks and special toys to play with while they’re on the potty are all great ways to foster their progress and reassure them if they regress a little bit. Toilet training praise and rewards will boost your toddler’s interest in learning how to use the toilet.</p>
                    <p>Here are some ideas that tend to work well with most kids. Remember, not all rewards have to be tangible – sometimes simple praise or a high-five will be enough to recognise your toddler’s efforts.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Colourful stickers to place on the rewards chart or even decorate their potty with</li>
                      <li>Colouring books and pencils</li>
                      <li>Reading books</li>
                      <li>Favourite snacks – you could try one for Number 1’s and two for Number 2’s</li>
                      <li>Going out for ice cream</li>
                      <li>Lego</li>

                      <h6>Wet or dry</h6>
                      <p>Point out things around the house and ask your toddler to tell you if they’re wet or dry. This helps them get a handle on what’s happening when they feel wet.</p>
                      <h6>Bathroom steps</h6>
                      <p>Have an arts and crafts day where you and your child cut out shapes (e.g. monster footprints or animal paws) marking a path to the bathroom. When kids start toilet training it’s easy for them to forget the way to the potty in the heat of the moment.</p>
                     <!-- <h6>Magic water</h6>
                      <p>Add a few drops of food colouring to your toilet bowl and watch your child’s amazement as the water changes colour when they wee!</p>
                      <h6>Treasure chest</h6>-->
                      <p>Make a treasure chest to store your child’s potty gear – containing everything they’ll want on hand to help them learn plus ‘treasures’ to reward them for a job well done. Find a box with a lid which flaps open, like a real treasure chest and together with your toddler, decorate it and write on their name. Now it’s time to fill it with treasures – stickers, storybooks, small musical instruments like a harmonica or bells, a stuffed animal, finger puppets, bubbles, small treats and of-course, Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants featuring their favourite character.</p>

Positive reinforcement is a big part of making the step towards the big finish and giving them the encouragement they need. <a href="https://www.huggies.com.au/system/cms/files/files/000/000/336/original/toilet-training-charts.pdf">Download and print the Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants graduation certificate</a> so they have official proof that they’re now a big kid!</p>

                  <h4>Top Tips for Training Boys</h4>
                  <div class="item_detail_info">
                    <p>Toilet training boys can seem like a particularly daunting task. Do you start him standing or sitting? When should you expect results? How important is a male role model? When looking for the answers it’s important to remember that every child progresses through toilet training at a different pace and there is no right or wrong way. Boys tend to take a few months longer than girls on average but that’s nothing to worry about. One thing is certain though, making the process fun and rewarding will help you and your little boy to succeed.</p>
                    <h5>A step-by-step guide</h5>
                    <p>Here are some key <a href="./docs/pull-ups-toilet-training-guide.pdf" target="_blank">toilet training steps</a> you and your little man can take to help kick things off smoothly:</p>
                    <h5>Toilet training seat or potty?</h5>
                    <p>It’s ultimately up to you to decide what both you and your child feel comfortable using, but often it can be a good idea to start toilet training with a potty. Children’s potties are easy for little ones to hop on and off and they are conveniently portable. “Big toilets” can seem a bit daunting at first. Eliminating nerves is a key for encouraging children to adopt new habits. Allowing her to pick out her own potty can make the transition even smoother. </p>
                    <h5>Sitting vs. standing</h5>
                    <p>Some little boys find standing up to wee quite scary at first, so if this is the case simply start sitting down. On the other hand, your son may have no problems at all, especially if he’s trying to copy the male role models in his life! It goes without saying though that you can expect a lot more mess if you kick off with standing!</p>
                    <h5>Show him how it’s done</h5>
                    <p>Little boys love to be just like their dad or big brother, and learn a lot by imitating people around them, so watching another male sitting on, or standing up at the toilet is a great way for them to see how it’s done. This is also a great way to help him gain the confidence to try it for himself. Don’t worry if there are no suitable male role models around when he’s ready to start toilet training – just show him sitting down and he can learn to stand up later on.</p>
                    <h5>Be patient</h5>
                    <p>Toilet training is a big change for little boys and it’s not a race. Accidents happen and it’s important to try and stay positive throughout the process. If your son is snubbing his potty, try not to push him. He will come around when he is ready.</p>
                    <h5>Use Huggies Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants for “big boys”</h5>
                    <p>Pick up some Huggies Pull-Ups for boys at the supermarket to help guide him through the toilet training process. They’ve been specifically designed to help him learn the most important parts of toilet training, including pulling up & down and the difference between wet from dry. Plus, they’ve got fun Disney Toy Story and Cars designs on them which we’re sure he’ll love.</p>
                    <h5>Here are some ways to help make toilet training a fun experience for your little boy:</h5>
                    <h6>Aiming for a target can be fun!</h6>
                    <p>Some boys have great success with this handy little device. Simply place it in the potty and get your little one to aim for the target. It will keep them focused on the middle of the bowl and will hopefully mean less mess for you to mop up!</p>

                    <h6>Food colouring works a treat!</h6>
                    <p>Try is putting some food colouring in the toilet to make it fun – your little boy can watch when the blue turns to green, or red turns to orange. </p> -->
                    <h6>Try a sticker rewards system</h6>

                    <p>If your daughter has been displaying signs of readiness for toilet training, it’s a great time to get started. For some girls toilet training will be a breeze. For others it can feel like a bit of a rollercoaster ride. In general, girls tend to pick up toilet training quicker than boys. However, if your daughter struggles with toilet training, remember to support her and give her lots of positive encouragement. Every child progresses with toilet training at a unique pace.</p>

                    <p>Kids love imitating their parents, which is very convenient when you’re trying to teach them something! Let your daughter watch you on the toilet so she can see how it’s done. Explain about wiping, flushing, and washing hands as you go. Once she has watched you a few times she’ll be excited to try it for herself. Imitation is one of the most common ways that toddlers learn new skills.</p>
                    <h5>Get some potty-friendly clothes</h5>
                    <p>Clothing for girls tends to be a little more complex than clothing for boys. Buttons, frills, flowy skirts and dresses, and delicate materials, such as lace, are not ideal during the toilet training phase. Your daughter will need clothing that can be removed quickly and easily while she’s still learning to make it to the potty in time. Pants with elastic waists are the way to go!</p>
                    <h5>Use Huggies Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants for “big girls”</h5>
                    <p>Getting out of nappies and into “Big Girl” undies is a big step for little girls. Pick up some Huggies Pull-Ups for girls at the supermarket to help guide her through the toilet training process. They’ve been specifically designed to help her learn the most important parts of toilet training, including pulling up & down and the difference between wet from dry. Plus, the pretty Disney Princess designs will help her look and feel every bit like the “Big Kid” she wants to be.</p>
                    <h5>Let her learn from her mistakes</h5>
                    <p>It’s not unusual for girls to want to wee standing up if they’ve watched their dad or older brothers using this method. It’s best to give kids as much independence as possible while they’re toilet training, so let her try standing up. She’ll realise straight away that this technique doesn’t work for her, and coming to the decision herself will give her more confidence than if you vetoed it from the start.</p>
                    <h5>Here are some ways to help make toilet training a fun experience for your little girl:</h5>
                    <h6>Pretty stickers to reward a job well done</h6>
                    <p>Download the FREE <a href="./docs/toilet-training-charts.pdf" target="_blank">Huggies Pull-Ups reward chart</a> and buy some pretty stickers to track her toilet training progress. Explain to her that every time she achieves something, e.g. making it to the potty in time, doing a poo without your help, she can get a reward. Stickers, books, colouring pencils, Lego, and favourite snacks make good prizes, so make sure you’ve always got something on hand.</p>
                    <h6>Take her shopping for big girl underwear</h6>
                    <p>Get your daughter excited for a shopping trip to buy big girl undies. Letting her pick some pairs with her favourite characters will keep her motivated to make it to the toilet.</p>

                    <!-- <h5>Get the basics right - Building a toilet training routine</h5> -->
                    <p>Once you kick things off with toilet training, try and work everything that you and your child do into a routine. This isn’t always so easy, as children’s bladders and bowels don’t always act according to plan! Get a grasp of how many times your child needs to go to the toilet in a day and when, and try to approach toilet training based on what you’ve learned about this behaviour.. Your child might be displaying all the signs of readiness, but it will still take some time before they fully recognise the physical urge to use the bathroom and know that they then need to make their way to the potty.</p>
                    <p>A consistent routine will build your child’s confidence as they will know exactly what to do, where to go and how to do it. Consistency and repetition helps them feel in control of the situation, and what’s coming up next. We’ve got a few tips here to help you build your toilet training routine.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>The 4 Musts</h5>
                    <p>Child development expert, Dr. Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett has 4 musts for toilet training. Keep these in mind and you’re headed for toilet training success!</p>
                    <h5>Let your child set the pace</h5>
                    <p>Trust your child, and let them set the pace. Don’t try to force them to learn too fast. Support them with the encouragement and positive feedback they need.</p>
                    <h5>Be Positive</h5>
                    <p>When accidents do arise, which they inevitably will, say ‘you’ll do better next time’ or ‘don’t worry about the accident, we’ll get it right soon to keep building confidence and encourage those “big kid” feelings.</p>
                    <h5>Be Consistent</h5>
                    <p>Avoid mixed signals. Switching back and forth to nappies is confusing to a child. Once you make the switch to training pants, stick with it. Wearing training pants makes your child feel like a ‘big girl’ or ‘big boy’.</p>
                    <h5>Be Patient</h5>
                    <p>There will be accidents! But mistakes are what we learn from. There may be times when your child seems like they are regressing. Don’t get discouraged – this is perfectly normal. Be confident that things will be back on track in no time.</p>
                    <h5>Stop! It’s Potty Time</h5>
                    <p>Successful toilet training occurs when your child can identify the physical urge to use the bathroom. Up until this point, a potty routine is necessary and will help your child get into the swing of things. Try the following schedule at first and then let your child run the show once they get the hang of it. It’s a good idea to take your child to the potty at the following times to help them get into a routine:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>When they wake up</li>
                      <li>An hour after a big drink</li>
                      <li>Before naps</li>
                      <li>After naps</li>
                      <li>Before meals</li>
                      <li>Before bed</li>
                      <li>If they wake up in the middle of the night</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Weeing on demand isn’t easy for any of us, so if they’re having trouble getting started, try reading to them while they’re on the potty to help them relax, or run the tap (it’s hard to not want to wee when you hear the sound of running water!). If they really don’t need to go, that’s fine, too. Simply ask them if they need to wee a couple of times before your next scheduled stop.</p>
                    <h5>Squeaky clean: Don’t forget to wipe & wash!</h5>
                    <p>Proper wiping and hand washing is a really important part of the toilet training routine, just as important as the potty visits themselves, so Teaching your child the right hygiene is important.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wiping:</strong> After doing a ‘number two’, like a big kid, teach them that they need to wipe themselves clean, and keep wiping until it comes back clean. </p>
                    <p><strong>Washing:</strong> Show your toddler how to wet their hands, apply soap and rub their hands together for long enough to cover all of their hands, rinse clean, and dry! The more you let them practice themselves, the better they will become at learning this new skill.</p>
                    <p> <img src="./images/wash-your-hands.png" alt="wash-your-hands" title="Wash Your Hands"/> </p>
                    <h5>Get everyone else on board</h5>
                    <p>It’s not likely that you’ll be around for every moment of your child’s toilet training journey, which is why it’s essential to get all other carers up to speed with the routine. Inform their day care, grandparents, babysitters, and anyone else who spends time alone with your toddler.</p>

                    <h5>Setting the facts straight</h5>
                    <p>There are many misconceptions about achieving day-time and night-time dryness in children, and understanding when a child is fully toilet trained. Many parents find that day time toilet training is a piece of cake compared to night time, and believe a similar process can be taught to prevent bedwetting but that’s not the case. That’s because it has nothing to do with your child as an individual, rather everything to do with the fact that lots of children simply haven’t developed the bladder capacity to hold urine over an entire night.</p>
                    <p>Night time dryness will typically come when your child’s bladder has developed enough to hold urine overnight, or when your child starts waking up to their body’s signal that they need to wee. Becoming dry at night can take anywhere from a few weeks or months to a few years and varies with each child. In fact at age 4, 25% of kids who are dry during the day will still be wetting the bed at night. Dry nights come with time and patience, and attempting to train your child out of bedwetting will only create unnecessary stress.</p>
                    <h5>Are rewards effective at night to train them to stay dry?</h5>
                    <p>Rewards systems are a great idea when your child is day time training. This is because when they’re awake they’re fully conscious and able to recognise and control when they need to use the potty. But night time is a whole different ball game, as when they’re asleep their bladder is out of their conscious control. </p>
                    <p>Imagine being offered $1,000,000 to stop snoring – no matter how much you want the money, you will continue to snore at night - the only way to stop yourself would be to stay awake! The same goes for bedwetting. There’s no harm in some gentle praise for a dry night, but don’t go overboard or heavily reward it, as it can make your toddler feel like a failure when they do happen to wet the bed and can actually do more damage their self-esteem.</p>
                    <h5>What about punishment, will that work?</h5>
                    <p>Be patient and reassuring and keep a positive attitude - it’s not a big deal to achieve dryness at night until the child is older. Yelling at, or punishing, the child for wetting the bed will only cause setbacks and in the meantime, do more damage to their self-esteem.</p>
                    <h5>So how do you handle it?</h5>
                    <p>The fact that they wet the bed is not something to be overly concerned about, because they’ll grow out of it as their body matures. Nighttime wetting can leave a child feeling embarrassed and upset because they can’t stay dry through the night, so the best thing to do is reinforce that it is not their fault by telling them they cannot stay dry through the night because their body hasn't matured yet and it is not a choice they make. Responding negatively to your child’s wetting can damage self-esteem and even prolong wetting. </p>
                    <h5>Setting up a bedtime routine</h5>
                    <p>Establishing a bedtime routine will help your little learner settle into a pattern, which will hopefully lead to consistently dry nights.</p>

                    <h5>Night time tips</h5>
                    <p>Try these tips to help with night-time bladder control:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Keep drinking water:</strong> While winding down fluids before bed is not harmful, limiting water intake too much can cause dehydration and constipation. It’s a good idea however to limit fizzy or sugary drinks after 5pm</li>
                      <li><strong>Take a trip to the bathroom before bed:</strong> This is a really important step in any bedtime routine</li>
                      <li><strong>Relocate the potty at night: </strong>A good idea is to place the potty near your child’s bed in case they wake in the night and need to wee. Young children can be scared of the dark so a small night light can ease their fears.</li>
                      <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.huggies.com.au/nappies/drynites">Use Huggies DryNites Pyjama Pants</a> at night:</strong> Before going all the way with undies, transition with Huggies DryNites. They’re designed to fit and feel more like real undies and come in great big kid designs to help give your child confidence and independence, while providing a safety net for any accidents</li>
                      <li><strong>Buy a mattress protector:</strong> Once you have transitioned to underwear at night, invest in a mattress protector to protect against any night –time accidents resulting in wet sheets</li>
                      <li><strong>Give ‘lifting’ a miss:</strong> Lifting a child out of their bed in the middle of the night and placing them on the toilet was once a very popular technique and while it’s a great idea to reduce the number of wet beds, it does not help to train the bladder to store more, nor does it teach children to wake on their own when the bladder sends signals to the brain telling them to wake up and go to the toilet.</li>
                      <li><strong>Buy easy-to-remove pyjamas:</strong> Make sure your little one can easily remove their PJs to wee in the middle of the night. Avoid any complicated buttons or frills.</li>
                      <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Try not to get visibly upset if your child wets the bed. Remember that they can’t control the situation right now. </li>
                      <li><strong>Morning routine:</strong> Encourage your child to go to the toilet as soon as they wake-up in the morning. This will help put the bladder on a schedule.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <div class="item_detail_info">
                    <h5>Confused about the best product to use for Toilet Training?</h5>
                    <p>Heard from your friends that Nappy-Pants are great for toilet training as they’re easy to pull up and down? Or that Pull-Ups Toilet Training Pants are the best option to help your little one learn? Preparation ,and using the right tools, is everything to help your little learner make the big leap from baby to big kid!</p>
                    <h5>The overview: Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants vs. Nappy-Pants</h5>
                    <p>You’ll already be aware that both of these products slide on like underwear. However, that’s pretty much where the similarities end.</p>
                    <h5>What are Nappy-Pants for?</h5>
                    <p>Nappy-Pants are designed for active babies who can’t sit still for a nappy change. You can pull on Nappy-Pants while your little one is standing up, making them perfect for squirmy bubs who would rather spend their time running about the house. Nappy-Pants have the same absorbency as a regular nappy and they look and feel just like regular nappies, too.</p>
                    <h5>What are Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants for?</h5>
                    <p>Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup> Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants are designed specifically for toddlers who are ready to start toilet training and make the transition from nappies to big kid undies. They’re made to look and feel like real undies with great Disney designs, and are easy to practice pulling up and down, just like real undies. The most important feature is the Learning Liner, designed to teach your child the difference between wet and dry by giving them feedback, or the sensation of wetness, when they’ve gone to the toilet in their pants. Regular nappies and nappy-pants don’t do this as they’re designed to quickly absorb and keep the inside dry. </p>
                    <h5>What is the Learning Liner?</h5>
                    <p>Pull-Ups have a unique learning liner that will help your child tell the difference between wet and dry. When your child starts to wee inside Huggies<sup>&reg;</sup>Pull-Ups<sup>&reg;</sup> Toilet Training Pants, the liner allows the feeling of wetness for a few minutes, giving your toddler enough time to register the sensation of wetness and be reminded that now is the ideal time for a potty visit!</p>

                    <h5>Once you’re out of nappies, it’s important to ditch them for good</h5>
                    <p>Moving out of nappies, and into training pants is a big milestone and signals the transition from baby to big kid! Using a mixture of nappies, nappy-pants and toilet training pants can be confusing for your toddler, and can even slow down or delay the process.</p>
